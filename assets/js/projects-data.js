        body: `
      At the Mountain of Madness is a fully illustrated reimagining of H.P. Lovecraft’s cult classic, brought to life through a bold and haunting visual style. This isn’t just a retelling: every page is charged with detailed artwork that intensifies the dread and mystery of the original story. From the icy desolation of Antarctica to the twisted alien architecture, the illustrations immerse you deep into Lovecraft’s cosmic horror - making the madness not just something you read, but something you see and feel.

      Il Germoglio is a branding and photography project developed for an agricultural company rooted in tradition but ready to grow.

      The work involved a complete redesign of the visual identity—from a refreshed logo to a new visual style that reflects the company’s values of sustainability, care, and authenticity. Alongside the branding, I produced a dedicated photo shoot to visually narrate the rhythms of the land and the people behind it. The project also included the design and development of the company’s new website, bringing coherence and personality across every touchpoint.

      "Jabberwocky" is a famous nonsense poem written by Lewis Carroll, included in his 1871 book "Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There," the sequel to "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland." Structure: The poem consists of seven stanzas, each with four lines. It is written in a meter similar to that of English ballads. Language: The poem is notable for its use of portmanteau words, invented by Carroll, which blend together parts of different words to create new ones with unique meanings. Words like "slithy" (a combination of "slimy" and "lithe") and "mimsy" (a blend of "miserable" and "flimsy") contribute to the whimsical and fantastical nature of the poem.
