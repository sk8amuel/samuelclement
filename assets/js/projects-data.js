      Il Germoglio is a branding and photography project developed for an agricultural company rooted in tradition but ready to grow.

      The work involved a complete redesign of the visual identity—from a refreshed logo to a new visual style that reflects the company’s values of sustainability, care, and authenticity. Alongside the branding, I produced a dedicated photo shoot to visually narrate the rhythms of the land and the people behind it. The project also included the design and development of the company’s new website, bringing coherence and personality across every touchpoint.

Speak Louder isn’t just a font—it’s a visual scream, built to feel as unapologetic and confrontational as the music that inspired it.

      The redesign includes a new logo, an updated visual style, and revamped packaging that blends tradition with minimal, elegant aesthetics. The goal: to enhance brand recognition, appeal to younger consumers, and reinforce Leone’s iconic status in the confectionery market.
