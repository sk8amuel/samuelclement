      After Book is a concept app brought to life through an animated promotional video, designed to enhance your reading experience through sound.
      The app generates adaptive background audio based on the content you're reading, whether it's a tense thriller, a peaceful fantasy, or a dramatic novel.
      As the story shifts, so does the atmosphere. I developed the idea and created the animated video to showcase how After Book turns every page into an immersive, multi-sensory experience.
